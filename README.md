# 3D Snake Game

This is a first-person perspective 3D snake game built from WebGL.

## Motivation

The style of the traditional snake game is too plain and cannot create an immersive game environment for players. We decided to modify the game into a 3D game with first-person perspective using what we have learnt in Advanced Computer Graphics to enhance user experience.

## Getting Started

Run the index.html or click this [link](https://qliuan.github.io/3D_Snake_Game/) to start the game.

## Prerequisites

You can use any modern browser that supports WebGL to run this game.

```
e.g. chrome, firefox
```

## Controls

* Use left and right arrows to rotate the moving direction of the snake.
* Use spacebar to start or pause the game.
* Use enter to restart the game.
